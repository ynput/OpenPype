traits:
  usage:
    description: >
      Base traits that scope a trait set for use within a specific
      context, such as resolution or relationship queries. Exactly
      one of these should be included in any given Specification.
    members:
      Entity:
        description: The trait set defines qualities of an entity.
        usage:
          - entity
      Relationship:
        description: >
          The trait set defines a relationship between one or more
          entities.
        usage:
          - relationship
  color:

      OCIOColorManaged:
        description: >
          Color data is managed using the OpenColorIO color management
          system.


          https://opencolorio.readthedocs.io
        usage:
          - entity
        properties:
          colorspace:
            description: >
              An OCIO colorspace name available in the "current" OCIO context.
            type: string
  content:
    description: Traits related to abstract content.
    members:
      LocatableContent:
        description: >
          This trait characterizes an entity whose data is persisted
          externally to the API through data accessible via a valid
          URL.


          The `location` property holds the most applicable location
          of the entity's content for the current process environment
          - considering platform, host, etc. Location is in the form
          of a URL.
        usage:
          - entity
        properties:
          location:
            type: string
            description: >
              The location of the entity's external content.


              This must be a valid URL, so special characters need to
              be encoded accordingly.
          mimeType:
            type: string
            description: >
              The MIME type of the data referenced by the location
              property.


              See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types/Common_types
          isTemplated:
            type: boolean
            description: >
              The URL in the location property contains variables (post
              decoding) that must be expanded before any loading is
              attempted.


              Variables use the OpenAssetIO syntax (eg:
              "image.{frame:04d}.{view}.exr") see the OpenAssetIO
              documentation for more details.


              The following well-known variables are defined within the
              MediaCreation ecosystem, and must be used where applicable
              to any specific workflow:

                - frame: An integer frame number for the current time.
                - view: A string representing the current view (eg.
                  "left").
  application:
    description: >
      Traits that describe the usage or function of structured data,
      that aren't strongly associated with any other more descriptive
      namespace.
    members:
      Config:
        description: >
          The entity data represents the configuration of a system,
          application or tool.
        usage:
          - entity
      Manifest:
        description: >
          The entity data represents a list or other manifest of
          associated entities or information.
        usage:
          - entity
      Work:
        description: >
          The entity data is the product of some manual task or process,
          that often defines how to produce or derive other data.


          Common examples are the documents opened, worked on and saved
          by artists using DCC tools to create models/images/etc.
  identity:
    description: Traits that aid the identification of an entity.
    members:
      DisplayName:
        description: >
          Names that can be presented to a user in order to identify
          and/or disambiguate the entity. These strings are potentially
          unstable and should not be used as a UUID or other persistent
          anchor.
        usage:
          - entity
        properties:
          name:
            type: string
            description: >
              The humanized name of entity itself, not including any
              hierarchy or classification.


              For example:
              - `"Cuttlefish v1"` - for a version of an asset
              - `"seq003"` - for a sequence in a hierarchy

          qualifiedName:
            type: string
            description: >
              An unambiguous, humanized name for the entity.


              The display name may want to consider the host, and any other
              relevant Context information to form a display name for an
              entity that can uniquely identify the entity in that context.


              For example:
              - `"dive / build / cuttlefish / model / v1"` for a version
                  of an asset in an 'open recent' menu.
              - `"Sequence 003 [ Dive / Episode 1 ]"` for a sequence in
                 a hierarchy as a window title.
  imaging:
    description: >
      Traits that are concerned with entities related to the derivation
      of an image from other source data.
    members:
      Camera:
        description: >
          The entity represents a device that captures a view through
          re-projection or encoding into some other form.
        usage:
          - entity
  metadata:
    description: >
      Traits that are concerned with describing additional data
      associated with an entity that is not considered part of its
      primary definition.
    members:
      ArbitraryMetadata:
        description: >
          Additional key/value pairs associated with the entity that
          have no standardised definition of their values. This allows
          extra data specific to any given use case or pipeline to be
          conveyed through the Traits mechanism.


          Hosts may propagate this data throughout their own data model
          for use in downstream actions.


          As there are no standardised keys, the low level TraitsData
          API must be used to determine which keys/values are present.
  threeDimensional:
    description: >
      Traits that are concerned with describing three-dimensional data,
      such as models, scenes, cameras, lights, etc.
    members:
      Spatial:
        description: >
          A family trait that should be composed with more specific
          traits for any entity that holds data described in three
          dimensions.
        usage:
          - entity
        properties:
          upAxis:
            type: string
            description: >
              The axis considered to point "up", legal values are: "y" or "z".


              It is assumed that the "x" axis is always horizontal,
              perpendicular to the depth axis. Consequently the depth
              axis is always which ever of "y" or "z" that is not set as
              the upAxis.
          handedness:
            type: string
            description: >
              Determines which direction positive depth is based on the
              "left hand or right hand rule"

              Legal values are "left" and "right"

      Shader:
        description: >
          The entity represents a parameterised algorithm that is
          evaluated during processing of a three-dimensional scene.
        usage:

      SourcePath:
        description: >
          Defines a singular path within the entity's scene
          hierarchy that should be used as the root, ignoring any other
          peer paths.

            type: string
      SourcePaths:
        description: >
          Defines the root paths within the entity data that form the
          start of a discrete hierarchy, labelled by the property key.


          For example:
            left: "/cameras/1103/camera/left"
            right: "/cameras/1103/camera/right"


          As there are no standardised keys, the low level TraitsData

  lifecycle:
    description: >
      Traits that are concerned with describing aspects of the life
      cycle of an entity, such as versioning.
    members:
      Version:
        description: >
          Describes a specific version of an entity.


          A version is defined as a revision or iteration of what is
          otherwise the same logical entity. If supported by a manager,
          versions are created when new data is published to an existing
          entity. Not all managers may version all types of entity.


          There is no requirement for version to be a singular atomic
          series, managers may wish to support "meta versions", such as
          'vLatest' or similar, or provide multiple parallel versioning
          streams.


          This trait can be used in several places:
           - When resolved, the manager should provide information about
             the version of the referenced entity. This trait should only
             be imbued if the target entity is considered versioned by the
             manager, and it can populate the stableTag property.
           - When responding to managementPolicy for an entity trait set,
             the manager should imbue this trait if that type of entity
             is version managed by the manager (not all managers version
             all types of entity).
           - When used within a relationship query, this trait indicates
             that the returned entities should be constrained to other
             versions of the logical entity targeted by the reference.
        usage:
          - entity
          - relationship
          - managementPolicy
        properties:
          specifiedTag:
            type: string
            description: >
              An unambiguous identifier (tag) for the specific version of
              an entity targeted by a specific reference.


              Examples of version tags include "1", "v2", "latest".


              If the reference itself does not contain a version
              specifier and relies on dynamic behaviour, this will be
              set to a tag that produces equivalent behaviour. This can
              then be used for user presentation or as a filter with a
              relationship query.
          stableTag:
            type: string
            description: >
              The tag (see 'specifiedTag') targeted by the reference once
              meta-versions or other dynamic behaviour is applied.


              If, for example, references without an explicit version
              yield the most recent, then this would be set to
              the tag of that version. When referencing some other
              semantic state (eg. approval), this would be set to the
              tag of the concrete version that matches the specific
              state.


              Examples of stable version tags include "1", "v2".


              This property should always be set when the Version trait
              is imbued as part of a resolve response. If the entity is
              not versioned, then the trait itself should not be imbued.
      Stable:
        description: >
          Defines that the entity references returned from a
          relationship query with this trait must be devoid of any
          dynamic behaviour. This includes concepts such as
          meta-versioning or context-specific variation that results
          logically different data being supplied.


          This is generally used to snapshot/bookmark specific
          configurations to avoid temporal instability and/or ensure
          processes are repeatable.


          Note: This does not include variations such as regional
          adaptation of the LocatableContent trait, where the underlying
          data remains the same.
        usage:
          - relationship
  managementPolicy:
    description: Traits used in a Manager's managementPolicy response.
    members:
      Managed:
        description: >
          A trait indicating that the data matching the supplied trait set
          is handled by the manager.


          There are three possible policies determined by
          applying/querying this trait:
          * If the response is not imbued with this trait, then the
            Manager has no interest in participating in the management of
            entities that match the queried trait set, for either read or
            write.
          * If the response is imbued with this trait, but the "exclusive"
            property is not set, or set to False, then the Manager would
              like the opportunity to manage the data, but the user should
              still be presented with standard Host UI for the type as an
              option.
            * If the "exclusive" property is set to true, then the Manager
              takes exclusive control over data with the queried trait set,
              and any standard host interfaces etc should be suppressed.
        usage:
          - managementPolicy
        properties:
          exclusive:
            type: boolean
            description: >
              Determines if the manager exclusively handles data matching
              the supplied trait set.


              If True, then standard host controls should be disabled
              in favour of manager delegated UI. For example, file system
              browsers when determining where to load/save data.


              If False, then standard host controls can be presented in
              addition to any custom manager UI.
  relationship:

      Unbounded:
        description: >
          The relationship may return large numbers of results for each
