<title>Layers visiblity</title>
<description>## All layers are not visible

Layers visibility was changed during publishing which caused that all layers for subset "{instance_name}" are hidden.

### Layer names for **{instance_name}**

{layer_names}

*Check layer names for all subsets in the list on the left side.*

### How to repair?

Reset publishing and do not change visibility of layers after hitting publish button.
