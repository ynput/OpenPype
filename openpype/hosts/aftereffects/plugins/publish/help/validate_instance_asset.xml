### __Detailed Info__ (optional)

This might happen if you are reuse old workfile and open it in different context.
(Eg. you created subset "renderCompositingDefault" from asset "Robot' in "your_project_Robot_compositing.aep", now you opened this workfile in a context "Sloth" but existing subset for "Robot" asset stayed in the workfile.)
