<description>## Nodes found with missing `cbId`

Nodes were detected in your scene which are missing required `cbId`
attributes for identification further in the pipeline.

### How to repair?

The node ids are auto-generated on scene save, and thus the easiest fix is to
save your scene again.

After that restart publishing with Reload button.

### How could this happen?
