Welcome to PYPE _config_ for [Avalon](https://getavalon.github.io/)

To get all the key information about the project, go to [PYPE.club](http://pype.club)


Currently this config is dependent on our customised avalon instalation so it won't work with vanilla avalon core. To install it you'll need to download [pype-setup](github.com/pypeclub/pype-setup), which is able to deploy everything for you if you follow the documentation.

_This configuration acts as a starting point for all pype club clients wth avalon deployment._
