## How to contribute to AYON
We are always happy for any contributions for AYON improvements. Before making a PR and starting working on an issue, please read these simple guidelines.

#### **Did you find a bug?**

1. Check in the [issues](https://github.com/ynput/OpenPype/issues) to make sure it wasn't reported already.
2. Ask on our [discord](https://discord.gg/ynput) Often, what appears as a bug, might be the intended behaviour for someone else.
3. Create a new issue.
4. Use the issue template for you PR please.


#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

- Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.
- Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

- Open a new thread in the [github discussions](https://github.com/ynput/OpenPype/discussions/new)
- Do not open issue until the suggestion is discussed. We will convert accepted suggestions into backlog and point them to the relevant discussion thread to keep the context.
- If you are already working on a new feature and you'd like it eventually merged to the main codebase, please consider making a DRAFT PR as soon as possible. This makes it a lot easier to give feedback, discuss the code and functionalit, plus it prevents multiple people tackling the same problem independently. 

#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

Open a new question on [github discussions](https://github.com/ynput/OpenPype/discussions/new)


## Pull Requests
- We have few requirements in branch naming. There must be one of prefixes in the branch name: `release/`, `enhancement/`, `feature/`, `bugfix/`, `documentation/`, `tests/`, `local/`, `chore/`. All characters lowered.
- Keep pull requests targeted to a single issue or feature. The review is usually much faster.
- If you are working on a new feature, please consider making a DRAFT PR as soon as possible. This makes it a lot easier to give feedback, discuss the code and functionality, plus it prevents multiple people tackling the same problem independently.
- PR resolving existing issue should have link to the issue in the description (`Resolves #123`) -> The issue will be automatically closed in that case.
- Follow PR template as much as possible. If the PR is fixing an issue add a link to issue or describe the issue in PR description.
